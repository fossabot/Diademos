## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, report it.

Contact an active contributor, such as the project lead, [Emil Sayahi](mailto:em@emsa.cf), and expect a response back within the week.
If your initial contact did not yield results, attempt to work with other contributors and [file an
issue](https://github.com/MadeByEmil/Diademos/issues/new) with the ```security vulnerability``` label.
